# About Proxyswap

## Protocol, Interface, Studio

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Proxyswap", some of which may confuse new users.

* [Proxy Studio](https://warpcast.com/proxystudio.eth):  The open venture studio which developed the Proxyswap protocol in collaboration with [FBI](https://warpcast.com/\~/channel/fbi)
* Proxyswap Protocol: Enables trading tokens on the [DegenChain](https://bridge.degen.tips/) L3 blockchain, with trusted logic and familiar feel from Uniswap V3. Token (ERC-20) Swaps are done peer-to-peer via forked [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/docs/blob/main/docs/contracts/v3/overview.md) smart contracts.
* [proxyswap.tips](https://proxyswap.tips/) Webpage: The UI frontend users use to trade on the Proxyswap Protocol. It is what users interact with to perform token swaps, liquidity pool actions, etc - while the Proxyswap Protocol enables the functionalities in the background. The source code can be found \[[here](https://github.com/demipoet/proxyswap)].
* Proxyswap DAO: A collection of members who decides the direction of the Proxyswap ecosystem by vote. Voting happens on Farcaster \[[here](https://farcaster.vote/app/#/communities/12)]. The $PROXY Token is required to vote, get $PROXY \[[here](https://proxyswap.tips/swap?outputCurrency=0xA051A2Cb19C00eCDffaE94D0Ff98c17758041D16)].

Please note that as the Proxyswap protocol v 0.1 is currently an identical fork of Uniswap V3 protocol, most of the documentation and concepts implemented in the DEX are the same.

## Future Vision

Our mission is to onboard users, teams and liquidity onto “degenchain” with a feature-rich trading platform fully integrated and informed by sufficiently decentralized social networks.

Proxywap was deployed for, and by Degens.
