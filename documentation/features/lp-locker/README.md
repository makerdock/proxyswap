# LP Locker

Lock any LP NFT on Proxyswap, claim fees on locked positions&#x20;

🔹 When you lock an LP NFT on Proxyswap, it means that you are using Proxyswap's LP locker service to lock your NFT, which represents your liquidity position. While your LP NFT is locked, any trading fees generated from the liquidity you have provided can still be claimed. This means:

🔹 Locking the LP NFT: You lock your LP NFT using the LP locker service on Proxyswap, meaning your liquidity position cannot be withdrawn for a certain period.

🔹 Generating Fees: As trades occur in the pool where your liquidity is provided, fees are generated.

🔹 Claiming Fees: Even though the actual liquidity is locked and cannot be withdrawn, you can still claim the trading fees accrued during the lock period
