# Token Launchpad

Create & airdrop tokens, with the following features:&#x20;

🔹 **Single-Sided Liquidity**: provide liquidity with even a singular token - no pairs needed.

🔹 **Locked Liquidity**: the liquidity you provide will be locked and cannot be withdrawn for a set period (aka no sudden rug-pulls).

🔹 **Trading Fees**: While your liquidity is locked, any fees generated from trades in the pool will be available for you to claim.

We've developed this mechanism to help projects build trust by ensuring liquidity is available for trading while still rewarding liquidity providers for their contributions.
