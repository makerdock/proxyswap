# Proxyswap DAO

## Mission

Proxyswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Degen Layer 3 (DL3), deployed and governed by Proxyswap DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. Proxyswap supports the growth of the DEGEN L3 ecosystem with safe, composable trading and liquidity provider (LP) infrastructure. Our mission is to onboard users, teams and liquidity onto ‚Äúdegenchain‚Äù with a feature-rich trading platform fully integrated and informed by sufficiently decentralized social networks.

Proxywap was deployed for, and by Degens.

## Who We Are

### Co-Founders

* Proxystudio.eth, pseudo anonymous founder of Proxy Studio, a Farcaster-native venture studio. [üîó](https://warpcast.com/proxystudio.eth)
* Saumya Saxena (saxenasaheb.eth) co-founded Farcaster Builders India (FBI), a collective of Indian builders and founders creating the next generation of onchain products, on the Superchain. [üîó](https://warpcast.com/saxenasaheb.eth)

## What We Built and Why

Proxyswap is the product of collaboration between two Farcaster communities, Proxy Studio and Farcaster Builders of India. Proxyswap v0.1 was bootstrapped with @proxystudio.eth‚Äôs daily degen tip allocation, and $4000 in ETH. A secure, usable dex with efficient, concentrated liquidity tools is necessary to advance key DL3 milestones: increased user adoption, and WETH/DEGEN liquidity sufficient to support onchain tipping on layer 3.

DEGEN began life as a memecoin, and a channel tipping token

DEGEN has since been adopted by tens of thousands of users, teams, and is the organizing element in a global ecosystem of apps, products, communities and now the Degen Layer 3 network DL3 is in the earliest stages of adoption, and a nascent ecosystem of projects has emerged organically & supported with funding from groups like Syndicate, 1confirmation, and Degen DAO SocialFi is the backbone of DEGEN and the future of Proxyswap. We plan to integrate Farcaster & the Degen community into the core of our decentralized exchange
