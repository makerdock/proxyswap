# Swaps

Swaps are the most common way of interacting with the Proxyswap protocol. For end-users, swapping is straightforward: a user selects an ERC-20 token that they own and a token they would like to trade it for. Executing a swap sells the currently owned tokens for the proportional([_1_](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/swaps#fn-1)_)_ amount of the tokens desired, minus the swap fee, which is awarded to liquidity providers([2](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/swaps#fn-2)). Swapping with the Proxyswap protocol is a permission-less process.
